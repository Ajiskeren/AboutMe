[00:19.26] Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
[00:26.38] I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought

[00:40.12] Know you're all that I want this life

[00:50.88] I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
[00:54.67] I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
[00:58.24] The ocean's colors on your face
[01:02.06] I'll leave my heart with your air
[01:06.35] So let me fly with you
[01:09.74] Will you be forever with me?
