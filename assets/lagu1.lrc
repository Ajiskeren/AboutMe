[00:11.42] I'm familiar with unrequited
[00:14.14] I know you got a heart that's undecided just like mine
[00:18.48] It takes its sweet time
[00:22.54] I been tryin' to dive into the deep end
[00:25.28] 'Cause I don't really wanna lose a good friend, but I might
[00:29.74] Find something divine
[00:33.74] It's electric every time we touch
[00:36.60] I've been livin' for this head rush
[00:40.39] But sometimes it's too much
[00:44.95] If we never try
[00:49.15] How will we know?
[00:51.91] Baby, how far this thing could go
[00:57.44] Give me a sign
[01:00.16] If I'm on your mind
[01:02.96] I don't wanna fall in love alone
[01:09.86] I wish that I could tell what you were thinkin'
[01:12.71] I hate that I slip up when I've been drinkin', but oh, well
[01:17.06] I can't help myself
[01:21.10] I'm gettin' really tired of this back and forth
[01:24.09] Why don't we just give in to this drivin' force, I mean
[01:28.26] There's somethin' between us
[01:32.49] It's electric every time we touch
[01:35.18] I've been livin' for this head rush
[01:38.93] But sometimes it's too much
[01:43.52] If we never try
[01:47.77] How will we know?
[01:50.47] Baby, how far this thing could go
[01:56.04] Give me a sign
[01:58.77] If I'm on your mind (do you mind a chair on my mind?)
[02:01.61] I don't want to fall in love alone (I don't wanna fall in love alone)
[02:06.16] If we never try (I don't want to fall in love alone)
[02:10.09] How will we know? (Oh, yeah)
[02:12.77] Baby, how far this thing could go (just how far this thing will go)
[02:18.46] Give me a sign (give me a sign, a sign)
[02:21.14] If I'm on your mind
[02:23.94] I don't wanna fall in love alone
[02:30.23] â™ª
[02:34.41] Ooh...
[02:39.28] Fall, I don't wanna fall
[02:44.95] I don't wanna fall in love alone (get a seat here, girl, right here, next to me)
[02:50.50] Fall, I don't wanna fall (next to me, next to me)
[02:56.04] I don't wanna fall in love alone (I don't wanna live without you, baby, anymore)
[03:01.68] Fall, I don't wanna fall (anymore)
[03:07.22] I don't wanna fall in love alone (I-I-I can't be alone)
[03:12.87] Fall, I don't wanna fall
[03:18.46] I don't wanna fall in love alone
[03:22.21]
